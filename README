This is an opensource project, so feel free to join.

General idea is to get insertions and delitions from all your repos.
So that you can see how much exp you gain each time you commit somthing.

HOWTO:
* You need to install "GitRPG_installer.exe" (installer is not ready yet)
* Edit post-commit file with a directory in wich you instellet GitPRG
* Take post-commit file and insert it into each ".git/hooks" folder of repository that you want to track
* Take post-commit file and insert it into ".../git/share/git-core/templates/hooks" so that all your new repo's will have that hook in them
* Lunch "GitRPG.exe" and try to commit somthing 

GitIgnore:
* If you do not whant to make new ".gitignore" file in each directory - make ".global_ignore" file in your User/UserName folder

Tray Features:
* left-click   - hides/shows window
* mouse-over   - shows stats in tray 
* right-click  - shows menu with some options

IDEAS:
* Achievements
* Rating
* SVN support ?

Files:
* raw - is a file made of git coomit history to track insertions and deletions (for 1 project)
* Stals - file made of all raw file for all your projects ( This file is updated each time you make a commit)
* post-commit - file used by git after commit to make raw file and call parse-raw.exe
* parse-raw.exe - this file parse raw every time it is made and adds stats to Stals
* Stats.grpg - stores stats for GitRPG programm itself. This is updated every time you lunch GitRPG.exe
* GitRPG.exe - main program that shows all your stats

GitHub Folders:
* git - parse-raw project folder
* GitRPG - is a qt project with gui
* GitRPG-build-desktop - place where GitRPG is builded
* images - here are images for the project (such as tray and application icons)
