This is an opensource project, so feel free to join.


General idea is to get insertions and delitions from all your repos. So that every time youre coding youre gaining exp.(For the number of lines) 

There also could be achievements( for example at least 100 lines of code per day for 3 days or 10 commits, 1000 lines total and so on)
Also this system can track several people and make rating.


At the begining i will make it just for one person and his local repos. Because otherwise it would a lot of work, and if nobody needs this , there is no scence. We'll see.

IDEAS:
* Achievements
* Rating

TODO:
* QT form
* script should launch parseRaw (parse-raw.exe) 
* (done) finish the consept
* (done) write first script to gather information from all repos 
* (done) use gitHub issues system

Files:
* raw - is a file made of git coomit history to track insertions and deletions (for 1 project)
* Stals - file made of all raw file for all your projects ( This file is updated each time you make a commit)
* post-commit - file used by git after commit to make raw file and call parse-raw.exe
* parse-raw.exe - this file parse raw every time it is made and adds stats to Stals
* Stats.grpg - stores stats for GitRPG programm itself. This is updated every time you lunch GitRPG.exe
* GitRPG.exe - main program that shows all your stats
