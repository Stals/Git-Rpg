This is an opensource project, so feel free to join.


General idea is to get insertions and delitions from all your repos. So that every time youre coding youre gaining exp.(For the number of lines) 

There also could be achievements( for example at least 100 lines of code per day for 3 days or 10 commits, 1000 lines total and so on)
Also this system can track several people and make rating.


At the begining i will make it just for one person and his local repos. Because otherwise it would a lot of work, and if nobody needs this , there is no scence. We'll see.

HOWTO:
* You need to install GitRPG (installer is not ready yet)
* Edit post-commit file with a diretory in wich you instellet GitPRG
* Take post-commit file and insert it into .git/hooks folder of repository you want to track
* Lunch GitRPG.exe and try to commit somthing 

Tray Features:
* double-click - hides and shows window
* middle-click - shows stats in tray
* right-click  - shows menu with some options

IDEAS:
* Tray icon and notifications
* Achievements
* Rating

Files:
* raw - is a file made of git coomit history to track insertions and deletions (for 1 project)
* Stals - file made of all raw file for all your projects ( This file is updated each time you make a commit)
* post-commit - file used by git after commit to make raw file and call parse-raw.exe
* parse-raw.exe - this file parse raw every time it is made and adds stats to Stals
* Stats.grpg - stores stats for GitRPG programm itself. This is updated every time you lunch GitRPG.exe
* GitRPG.exe - main program that shows all your stats

GitHub Folders:
* git - parse-raw project folder
* GitRPG - is a qt project with gui
* GitRPG-build-desktop - place where GitRPG is builded
* images - here are images for the project (such as tray and application icons)
* oldthing - just old scripts i don't want to delete yet
